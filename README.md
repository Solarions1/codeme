# Main page of my repository

Public repository where I will be adding skills and updating changes in my projects, yes, I will use it as a diary because... why not?

### Hi, my name is Manuel

## What am I looking for with this site and its public repository?


This page is designed in Javascript using ejs, the main purpose of this page is to demonstrate my skills as a developer, this is just an example and is not completely accurate as I am constantly learning more, this in order to improve my skills and abilities.

Yes, this repository is public because in it are my skills, knowledge and some other things, anyone can enter and copy the code, but it is better to teach how to use it, right? in that case a little further down I put how to use it and or copy it, in case of urgency.




## What applications or code do I have in my repositories?

Currently in my repositories I use different types of code, among them I specialize in javascript with Node js, this allows me to develop everything in less time, of course, other languages are also important as react, c#, c++, go, etc, if you want to see a total count of my skills,[visit my page.](https://solarions1.github.io/codeme/)


## Important information and use in my projects

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Expressjs using in Nodejs](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Report issues here](https://github.com/Solarions1/codeme/issues)

This documentation serves as a guide to run the projects I have, currently in use in AWS, Google Cloud.

To execute the js files, follow the command below:
   
   `git clone (repository name`
   `npm install dependences` or : `npm i nodejs`  ---> `npm install express` and the other modules used you need install, please read the `package.json` file in repository cloned and follow instructions.

The code of my projects is currently public and free to use, this does not mean that its use can be done in a delivered way, these contain a license of use and however minimal it may seem must be respected, the code can be used freely but if possible (using the same template) you can mention me with a // credits to Manuel (https://github.com/Solarions1), it does not cost you anything, total honesty above all, no? besides, nobody will see that section *gi√±o*.

## What is an Identity Provider (IdP)?

An *Identity Provider* is a system that provides authentication services for your workloads and ultimately decides whether to authenticate a user.

In addition to providing authentication services, IdPs often manage the identities themselves.

Common identity providers include:
* Active Directory
* Azure Active Directory
* IDaaS pricers such as Okta or Ping Identity
* Other LDAP directories

## What do other Cloud Providers recommend?

The following test was extracted from Google Cloud documentation:

*For applications that you plan to develop, OAuth 2.0 or OIDC should be your preferred choice. These protocols are widely adopted, and you can take advantage of many well-tested libraries and tools.*

## What is the difference between the Authorization Code and the Access Token?

This is also a very common question. 

The `Authorization Code`, which is used in the `Authorization Code Grant Type`, is a representation of the End-User's concent and it is invalidated as soon as it's redeemed. So it's only used once. This code is sent from the Authorization Server to the Client, when the End-User concents, and then it is sent by the Client to the Authorization Server which redeems it and exchanges it for an `Access Token`.

The `Access Token`, on the other hand, is sent by the Client to the Resource Server and if valid is exchanged by the resource. The Access Token can be used as much as needed within its validity.
